Module 5 Project


This is the README file for the Module 5 project in CS305_Module05. 

For this project I have added a file called rotate_point.c that when ran, allows the user to enter the x coordinate, y coordinate, and the degrees to rotate. 

The program then calculates the new point based on the degrees that the user entered to rotate them. 

To install the program the user simply needs to download the file then open a $BASH command prompt and type: 

gcc -Wall rotate_point.c -o rotate_point

Then to run the program the user needs to type: 

./rotate_point

Example Output: 

$ ./rotate_point
Please enter an x coordinate: 30
Please enter a y coordinate: 1
Please enter the number of degrees to rotate by: 45
The result is (21.920310, 20.506097)
